## About the project

•	This project showcases lucid visualizations in Tableau to analyze 6.5 million records to unlock insights about the increasing CO2 emissions over the past centuries leading to the global warming in order to create awareness among the people.

• The visualizations are created to analyze the average contribution made by different countries towards the CO2 emissions beginning from early 1800's and compared the growth in population versus the increasing CO2 emissions.
